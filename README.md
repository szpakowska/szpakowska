# 👋 Hello, I'm Ania!

I work as an Application Support Specialist 👩‍💼 with a passion for learning Java. Currently, I'm on a journey to transition into the role of Intern/Junior Java Developer, kickstarting this transition through participation in the "GO FOR JAVA GIRL" program proudly organized
by Women in Technology ☕🚀. 

🌱 I'm enthusiastic about Java, and my repositories are a reflection of my learning journey. You'll find various projects where I explore the world of Java 📚💻. I'm always eager to connect with fellow developers and learners, so feel free to explore my code and share your thoughts.

📫 You can connect with me on https://www.linkedin.com/in/szpakowska/.

Happy coding! 🚀
