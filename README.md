# 👋 Hello, I'm Ania!

I work as an Application Support Specialist 👩‍💼 with a passion for learning Java. Currently, I'm on a journey to transition into the role of Intern/Junior Java Developer, kickstarting this transition through participation in the "GO FOR JAVA GIRL" program proudly organized
by Women in Technology ☕🚀.
